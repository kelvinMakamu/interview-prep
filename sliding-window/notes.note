Subarrays for positive integer arrays:
:: check the condition clearly
:: process till the condition is met or surpassed(>=condition)
:: start shrinking
For a string to obtain substring
:: check the condition clearly
:: use dynamic sliding window whenever possible
:: use hashmap to keep track of character frequency
:: add characters into the hashmap till the condition is violated
:: shrink the window - decrease frequency of characters in the hashmap
NB: Always return what is asked
