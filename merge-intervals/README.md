## Merge Intervals
- overlapping intervals
- Two intervals (a,b) rshps:
- ``` 1. a and b do not overlap ```
- ``` 2. a and b overlaps, b ends after a ```
- ``` 3. a completely overlaps b ```
- ``` 4. a and b overlaps, a ends after b ```
- ``` 5. b completely overlaps a ```
- ``` 6. a and b do not overlap ```

## Merge Intervals Pattern
- list mutually exclusive intervals
- check for overlapping intervals

## Common challenges
- Intervals intersection
- Maximum CPU load
